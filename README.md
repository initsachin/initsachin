<h1> Hi there, I'm Sachin CS 👋 </h1>


<h4>Whom am i </h4>
I develop AI agents and ship production ready reference implementations that developers can plug in immediately.


My work emphasizes hands on engineering robust codebases, reusable design patterns, and end to end tested architectures for agent systems, multi agent coordination, RAG pipelines, tool calling, memory frameworks, and LLM apps running locally or in the cloud.

<h4> What I Do </h4>  

🧠 AI Agents: Single agent, multi agent, MCP based, browser agents, voice agents, local agents

📦 Ready To Deploy Agents: Git Clone → Install → Run

🌱 Building what's next in AI Agents, RAG, or LLMs? I'd love to chat and share input.

🚀 Fine tuning: Llama, Gemma , Deepseek and Qwen
